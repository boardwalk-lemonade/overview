# Overview
This project is a learning project and demonstration of several technologies
for building cloud native applications in a DevOps manner. The application
under development is not overly complex but service to illustrate some
interesting issues with layered services, monitoring and with reactive
web design. 

# Subject Application 
The subject application simulates a lemonade stand serving customers from
services providing services for lemonade, ice tea, ice cubes and cups to
hold the delivered product. 

The sketch of the design looks like this:

The application consists of a UI which will show the product (virtual product,
lemonade or ice tea with ice cubes in cups) being produced.
