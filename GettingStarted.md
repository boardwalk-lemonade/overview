# Prerequisites
 
This lists software you will need on your PC in order
to work effectively with the demo.
 
## Browser

Install a web browser, gosh, so you can visit:

##  Cloud CLI
Your cloud provider's command line tool (CLI)

1. GCP for Google cloud
   https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install
1. Azure for Microsoft Azure
   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest
1. AWS for Amazon
   https://aws.amazon.com/cli

## Code Editor (optional)

If you want to edit the java code, using an IDE is good. If you are an
Eclipse user, use the Spring Tools Suite (STS):
https://spring.io/tools

Or use IntelliJ, Emacs, or your favorite syntax-highlighted editor. An
editor that assists with `yaml` syntax is very useful.
